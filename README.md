Writing tools for Vim

Vim isn't just for the savvy programmer—it's for writers too. Having written plenty of blog posts, short stories, and some half-finished novels, I came up with a few ideas for a smoother Vim writing experience.

## What does it do?

1. Browse markdown table of contents and jump to different sections
2. Re-arrange chapters and sections quickly and easily
3. Quickly insert comments and notes via markdown footnotes
2. Highlight adverbs, clichés, and phrases that might need editing
3. Typewriter mode for distraction-free writing
4. Word count & position on custom status bar

More features are being added as I can think of them.
